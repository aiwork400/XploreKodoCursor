# Project Context: XploreKodo Global Mobility Hub

## 1. Unified Mission Statement
XploreKodo is a 360° AI-powered lifecycle platform for Nepali human capital. 
- **The Journey:** Application -> Trilingual Training (N5-N3, Kaigo, AI/ML) -> Visa Automation (COE/Legal) -> Global Logistics -> Post-Placement Lifecycle Support (Life-abroad troubleshooting).
- **Core Interfaces:** Interactive Voice Agents, 3D Avatars (iOS/Android), and AR-VR Classrooms for immersive vocational training.

## 2. Technical & Commercial DNA
- **Phase 1 (The Foundation - SOW1):** Trilingual core, Visa/Legal document vault, Candidate onboarding, Stripe/PayPal integration, and N5/N4 proficiency modules.
- **Phase 2 (The Enrichment - SOW2):** AR-VR Classrooms, Voice-based Mock Interviews, AI-Avatar "Senseis," and post-placement "Advisory Bot" for troubleshooting life in Japan.
- **Commercial Flagging:** Phase 2 features must be built but dormant (toggleable) via `PHASE_2_ENABLED` environment variables.
- **Self-Maintenance:** The swarm must provide automated operational reports, monitor its own health, and search official APIs (Visa/Labor laws) to remain legally updated.

## 3. Security & Standards
- **Chain of Custody:** Secure handling of Passports, COEs, and financial records.
- **Token Optimization:** Mandatory context management to ensure zero knowledge gaps during the 2-month sprint.
