Date: January 07, 2026

1. Mission Statement
Xplora Kodo is designed as a premier Agentic Platform for global candidates seeking to enter the Japanese workforce. Our mission is to serve as the ultimate "Gateway," bridging the gap between foundational language skills and professional readiness through AI-driven, personalized coaching.

2. The Triple-Track Coaching System
The platform evaluates and trains candidates across three distinct professional tracks to ensure diverse career opportunities:


Care-giving Track: Focused on specialized 'Kaigo' vocabulary and social-logic required for elderly care facilities .


Academic Track: Targets high-level honorifics and vocabulary for MEXT scholarships and university entrance .


Food/Tech Track: Prepares entrepreneurs and tech professionals for Japan’s startup ecosystem and AI/ML sectors .

3. Mastery & Evaluation Framework
Candidate progress is measured through three core skill categories:

Vocabulary: Acquisition of track-specific terminology.

Tone/Honorifics (Keigo): Mastery of politeness levels essential for Japanese society.

Contextual Logic: The ability to apply language correctly within situational business or care-giving scenarios.

Performance Milestone: An Early Readiness status is achieved at a 20.0% mastery level, placing the candidate on the JLPT N5 Path.

4. Technical Primitives (The All-in-One Shop)
All development on the Xplora Kodo platform adheres to these core standards [cite: 2025-12-21]:

Dynamic Data Sync: Reports must reflect a real-time merge of PostgreSQL database records and session-specific JSON progress files.

Agentic Interaction: The Sensei agent must move beyond static scripts, using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide grounded, project-specific guidance.

Visual Professionalism: Official performance reports must be dynamically generated, stable in layout, and provide clear visa and career outlooks based on performance data.
