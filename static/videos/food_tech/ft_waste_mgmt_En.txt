Proper waste management is part of HACCP. In Japan, we do not just throw things away.Separate your waste into 'Moeru' (Burnable), 'Moenai' (Non-burnable), and 'Shigen' (Recyclables). Cardboard and plastic bottles are 'Shigen'. Food waste is 'Moeru'. I like to ask you which bin a plastic mayonnaise bottle belongs to after it has been rinsed.
