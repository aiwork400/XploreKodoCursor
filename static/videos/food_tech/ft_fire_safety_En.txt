Welcome to the Fire Safety module. In a Japanese kitchen, safety is a team effort. After this video, I will ask you to record your voice performing a Point-and-check for a kitchen frye. When you check the gas, you must use 'Yubisashi Tenken'. Point your finger at the valve and say: 'Valve Heisa, Yoshi!' (Valve closed, OK!). This prevents simple mistakes.
