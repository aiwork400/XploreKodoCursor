Also, while '衛生 (Eisei)' translates to hygiene or sanitation, simply wiping with a dry cloth might not achieve a satisfactory level of 'Eisei'. Consider adding details about the type of floor and dirt, and whether you used any cleaning products. Are you asking if it *promotes* 'Eisei' or achieves a certain level of it?",
                "grammar_feedback": "The grammar is correct. However, consider phrasing it as 'Is this a hygienic way to clean?' or 'Does this adequately sanitize the floor?' for more natural phrasing. You could also ask 'Does this contribute to good 衛生 (Eisei)?'"

However, specifying 'safety shoes' instead of simply 安全靴 and 'hygiene' instead of 衛生 would make the sentence flow more naturally in English.",
                "grammar_feedback": "The grammar is generally correct, but the sentence sounds slightly stilted. Combining the two ideas into one sentence might improve flow: 'I will always wear safety shoes (安全靴) and maintain kitchen hygiene (衛生) because sanitation is my top priority.'"
