Welcome to JLPT N5 Grammar. Today we distinguish between the topic marker 'Wa' (は) and the subject marker 'Ga' (が). Example 1: 'Chuubou wa kirei desu' (As for the kitchen, it is clean). Example 2: 'Chuubou ga kirei desu' (The kitchen [specifically] is the one that is clean). In a commercial center, using 'Ga' might identify a specific room that needs inspection, while 'Wa' describes the general state.
