SENSEI: Welcome to the Commercial Center Kitchen Safety module. 
Today, we focus on three vital terms for your competency assessment.

1. 衛生 (Eisei) - Hygiene/Sanitation. 
In a commercial kitchen, eisei is our top priority to prevent food poisoning.
Example: 厨房の衛生はとても重要です (Chūbō no eisei wa totemo jūyō desu) - Kitchen hygiene is very important.

2. 安全 (Anzen) - Safety. 
We use anzen-gutsu (safety shoes) to prevent slips on wet floors.
Example: 安全第一 (Anzen Daiichi) - Safety First.

3. 清掃 (Seisō) - Cleaning/Cleaning up. 
At the end of every shift, a thorough seisō of all surfaces is required.

Socratic Goal: Students must understand the difference between general cleaning (seisō) 
and the broader concept of professional sanitation (eisei).
